# NYC Crime: An Analysis of NYPD Complaint Data

## Introduction
Living in New York City, we are all used to daily crimes throughout the city. The city of New York gathers information regarding NYPD complaints, which includes felonies, misdemeanors, and violation crimes. Understanding this data can provide insight into crime locations and types of crimes in NYC.

## Objectives
- Analyze when crimes in NYC take place.
- Examine which neighborhoods/boroughs experience a higher crime rate.
- Analyze the distribution of specific crime categories (e.g., violent vs property).
- Analyze the groups that experience the most crime (e.g., age, race, etc.).
- Create visuals to show the findings of this project.

## Data Collection
This project uses the **NYPD Complaint Data Current (Year To Date)** dataset from [NYC Open Data](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/NYPD-Complaint-Data-Current-Year-To-Date-/5uac-w243/about_data). The dataset contains information about complaints, including borough, level of offense, date, victim demographics, and police precinct.

Preprocessing steps will clean and organize this data for analysis.

## Deliverables
- A Jupyter Notebook with:
  - Code for data preprocessing and addressing project objectives.
  - Visualizations like pie charts and bar charts to show trends in boroughs, crime types, victim demographics, and times of crimes.
- A report interpreting the significance of the visualizations in the context of NYC crime trends.

## Conclusion
This project aims to analyze patterns and trends of crime in NYC over the last five years. With this analysis, we can identify parts of NYC that may need changes or higher priority for crime prevention.
