# NYC Crime: An Analysis of NYPD Complaint Data

## Introduction
Crime affects New Yorkers daily across the city. To better understand these incidents, the NYPD collects extensive data on complaints, including felonies, misdemeanors, and violations. Analyzing this dataset provides valuable insights into crime patterns, locations, and demographic impacts across NYC.

## Objectives
- Analyze when crimes in NYC take place.
- Examine which neighborhoods/boroughs experience a higher crime rate.
- Analyze the distribution of specific crime categories (e.g., violent vs property).
- Analyze the groups that experience the most crime (e.g., age, race, etc.).
- Create visuals to show the findings of this project.

## Data Collection
This project uses the **NYPD Complaint Data Current (Year To Date)** dataset from [NYC Open Data](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/NYPD-Complaint-Data-Current-Year-To-Date-/5uac-w243/about_data). The dataset contains information about complaints, including borough, level of offense, date, victim demographics, and police precinct.

Preprocessing steps will clean and organize this data for analysis.

## Deliverables
- A Jupyter Notebook with:
  - Code for data preprocessing and addressing project objectives.
  - Visualizations like pie charts and bar charts to show trends in boroughs, crime types, victim demographics, and times of crimes.
- A report interpreting the significance of the visualizations in the context of NYC crime trends.

## Project Goals
This project aims to analyze patterns and trends of crime in NYC over the last five years. With this analysis, I can identify parts of NYC that may need changes or higher priority for crime prevention.

## Findings & Insights
Based on my analysis, I discovered the following key crime trends in NYC:
- **Peak Crime Times:** Crime reports are highest between **3 PM and 7 PM**, aligning with after-school and post-work hours.
- **Crime by Borough:** **Brooklyn and Manhattan** have the highest number of reported incidents, while Staten Island reports the fewest.
- **Crime Types:** Misdemeanors make up the largest portion of complaints, followed by felonies and violations.
- **Demographics:** The **age group 25-44** experiences the highest number of reported crimes, and Black and Hispanic victims are overrepresented in certain offense categories.
- **Seasonal Trends:** A significant number of crime reports occur in the first three months of the year, suggesting possible data inconsistencies or seasonal crime trends.

## Conclusion
This project provides an overview of crime distribution across NYC, helping identify potential areas that require more law enforcement resources or crime prevention strategies. Further research could focus on predictive crime modeling or exploring external factors (e.g., economic conditions, weather, or policing policies) that influence crime patterns.
